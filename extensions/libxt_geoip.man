The extra files you will need is the binary database files. They are generated
from a country-subnet database with the geoip_csv_iv0.pl tool that should be
available in /usr/lib(exec)/xtables-addons/ . The resulting files MUST be moved
to /usr/share/xt_geoip/
as the shared library is statically looking for this pathname (e.g.
/usr/share/xt_geoip/LE/de.iv0).
