config NETFILTER_XT_TARGET_TARPIT
	tristate '"TARPIT" target support'
	depends on NETFILTER_XTABLES
	---help---
	Adds a TARPIT target to iptables, which captures and holds incoming TCP
	connections using no local per-connection resources. Connections are
	accepted, but immediately switched to the persist state (0 byte
	window), in which the remote side stops sending data and asks to
	continue every 60-240 seconds. Attempts to close the connection are
	ignored, forcing the remote side to time out the connection in 12-24
	minutes.

	This offers similar functionality to LaBrea
	<http://www.hackbusters.net/LaBrea/>, but does not require dedicated
	hardware or IPs. Any TCP port that you would normally DROP or REJECT
	can instead become a tar pit.
